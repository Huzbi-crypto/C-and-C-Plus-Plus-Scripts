# Introduction
## Description
### Details:
This is a 3-D spinning animation of a cube created with the help of mathematics. It's basically a method similar to how I coded the donut animation to make an animation by rotating a specific 3-D image in a 2-D plane. When you run build the code you will see its output
and will realize how it is possible.
### Instructions on Building From Source:
1. Copy the code,
2. Inside the folder of the source code, run `gcc cube.c -o {YOUR-EXECUTABLE-NAME}`.
3. Then run the executable that was built from the above command.
### Requirments:
- A C compiler, such as MingW or MYSYS.

**NOTE:** It is possible that the escape sequences `\x1b[2J` and `\x1b[H` might not work properly depending on the shell you use. It didn't perform correctly for my powershell and command prompt versions but a friend of mine's worked somewhat properly. It worked correctly on Linux shells.
